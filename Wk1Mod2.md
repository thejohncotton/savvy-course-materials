## HTML5, style, and CSS

---
### Warm Up:
1. Use Atom to add a fun fact about yourself to the `README.md` file in your project directory.
2. `stage`, `commit`, and `push` your changes to GitHub
3. In `index.html`, add a line of `lorem ipsum`.
4. `stage`, `commit`, and `push` your changes to GitHub
5. Verify that your new `index.html` content has been deployed through Netlify

---

### HTML
HTML (Hyper-Text Markup Language) is a markup language for describing the structure and content of web documents (web pages). It is comprised of markup tags and text content nested inside each other.
![standard HTML structure](http://reactorprep.herokuapp.com/assets/images/html_breakdown.png).

HTML tags are keywords (tag names) surrounded by angle brackets:

#### `<tagname> content </tagname>`
+ HTML tags normally come in pairs like `<p>` and `</p>`
+ The first tag in a pair is the start tag, the second tag is the end tag
+ The end tag is written like the start tag, but with a slash before the tag name

By following the proscribed rules of HTML, a web browser understands this to be a document with a heading and a paragraph. Here is what the browser interpreter thinks when given (this code):
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Page Title</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>My First Heading</h1>
    <p>My first paragraph.</p>
  </body>
</html>
```
+ The `!DOCTYPE` declaration defines the document type to be HTML
+ The text between `<html>` and `</html>` describes an HTML document
+ The text between `<head>` and `</head>` provides information about the document
+ The text between `<title>` and `</title>` provides a title for the document
+ The text between `<body>` and `</body>` describes the visible page content
+ The text between `<h1>` and `</h1>` describes a heading
+ The text between `<p>` and `</p>` describes a paragraph

---

#### EXERCISE 1

It's time to take a look at how browsers (like Chrome) render HTML content!
1. Create a new `example.html` file and paste in the following:
  ```html
  <!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>HTML EXAMPLE</title>
</head>
<body>

  <h1>HTML Example 1</h1>
  <p>[CMD + OPT + U] to view the source code of this HTML document.</p>
  <p>Now close the source code and inspect the document in the Elements panel of your Chrome Developer Tools [CMD + OPT + I] instead</p>
  <p>Use the magnifying glass in the top left to select elements in the window area.</p>
  <p>
    W  O  A  h
      WHAT'S
    GO  -  ING
                      on


    h   e   r   e
                !
          !
    !
  </p>
  <!-- ALERT: THIS IS JUST A COMMENT -->

  <!--

      SECRET: Developers often use comments to annotate their code.

              ...or complain about their bosses. They aren't rendered on the page.
              So only people who view the source code get to see them. Fun!

  -->
</body>
</html>

  ```
2. Open up Chrome's Dev Tools and take a look at Elements and their associated STYLES:
  ![dev tools](http://reactorprep.herokuapp.com/assets/images/elements.png)

3. ANSWER AS A GROUP:
  1. What `font-size` does the browser give an `<h1>` element by default?
  2. What `font-weight` does the browser give an `<h1>` element by default?
  3. How does the browser render the extra spaces and new lines in the last paragraph?
  4. Are there any parts of the body that are not rendered into the browser window?

---

### Portfolio Project 1

Now it's time to turn your `README.md` into a landing page for your portfolio site! Since browsers don't work with Markdown by default, we want to use HTML for our Portfolio on the web. Go through the following steps to get started:

1. Make sure that you're inside your portfolio project directory (called `FirstnameLastname`).
2. All browsers look for an `index.html` file to display by default. You can name other pages whatever you'd like, but the landing page for every site should always be `index.html`. We created this file last time, but verify that it's still there with the content you expect.
3. Edit `index.html` in Atom. Make sure that it includes the following BEFORE we start porting in text from `README.md`:
  1. `<!DOCTYPE HTML>`
  2. `<html>`,`<head>`, and `<body>` tags
  3. `<title>` tags and a title of `Firstname Lastname | Web Developer`

  *HINT: you can use emmet's HTML boilerplate by typing* `!` *then pressing* `TAB`

4. Then you can start moving content from `README.md` into `index.html`
  1. Use `<h1>` for headings
  2. Use `<p>` for paragraphs of text
  3. Use `<ul>` for unordered lists (and use `<li>` for each nested list element)
  4. Use `<hr>` to create an horizontal rule
  5. Use `<br>` to add extra line breaks between elements
  6. Make sure you've saved the file!
  7. To see what your page looks like, we'll use `atom-live-server` and a browser! Use `CTRL + ALT + 3`, then navigate to `localhost:3000` in your browser.

### More HTML tags
#### EXERCISE 3
Create a new file with `touch example.html`. Open this file in Atom and paste in the following HTML:

```html
<html>
  <head>
    <title>More styles!</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>This is a header</h1>
    <h2>This is an even smaller header</h2>
    <h3>Even smaller...</h3>
    <h6>Quite small</h6>
    <p>Here is some normal text. A paragraph, even!</p>
    <p><i>This text is in italics.</i></p>
    <p><b>This text is in bold.</b></p>
    <p><b><i>This text is in both.</i></b></p>
    <p><del>This text is rendered with strikethrough.</del></p>
    <p>Sometimes you want to embed some <i>stylized text</i> right into <b>your paragraph.</b> Pretty cool, right!</p>
    <p>You could BREAK <br> the line, but it's not used very often these days.</p>
    <hr>
    <ul>
      <li>Item</li>
      <li>Item</li>
      <li>Another item</li>
    </ul>
    <p>w/ sub-lists</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Item one</li>
      <li>Item two</li>
      <li>Item three
        <ul>
          <li>Sub-item</li>
          <li>Sub-item</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Item four</li>
    </ol>
    <p><a href="http://www.google.com">I&#39;m a link to a web page!</a></p>
    <p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/81qyN1y.jpg" alt="This text will show up, only if the image doesn't (also good for screen readers)"></p>
    <p><img src="../../assets/images/profile.png" alt="local photo"></p>
  </body>
</html>
```
Then go to `localhost:3000/example.html` and answer the following:

1. What `font-size` does the browser give an `<h2>` element by default?
2. What `font-size` does the browser give an `<h6>` element by default?
3. What `font-style` does the browser give an `<em>` element by default?
4. What `text-decoration` does the browser give an `<a>` element by default?
5. What `list-style-type` does the browser give a `<li>` element?


#### Attributes
This link tag has an attribute whose name is `href` and whose value is a `url`:
![anchor tag](http://reactorprep.herokuapp.com/assets/images/links.png)

Attributes provide additional information about an element. They appear on the opening tag of the element and are made up of two parts: a **name** and a **value**, separated by an equals sign.

Image tags (`<img>`) have an attribute named `src` whose value is the location of the image to be displayed, like this:

```html
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/81qyN1y.jpg" alt="This text will show up, only if the image doesn't (also good for screen readers)">
```

### Portfolio Project 2

Let's expand on the landing page we've already made for our online portfolio!

While it's possible to link to HTML documents in your website with any name (as long as they have the `.html` file extension), it's generally considered best practice to create new directories for each page. At the root of each new directory should be another `index.html` file. This makes the URL prettier when users search your site, and it organizes things a bit better for future developers. Let's set up a 'Projects' page using this method:

1. If you're already in the Portfolio page's root (or top-level) directory, make a new directory called 'projects' (HINT: `mkdir projects`). Remember that different capitalizations are different addresses, so keep a consistent naming convention for all folders (i.e. don't capitalize any words, and separate multi-word directory names with hyphens, e.g. `my-favorite-directory` instead of `MyFavoriteDirectory`).
2. Now navigate into your newly-created projects folder (HINT: `cd projects`) and create another `index.html` file (HINT: `touch index.html`).
3. Use Atom to edit your new `projects/index.html` file.
  1. Set the page up just like any other HTML document (see the emmet shortcut).
  2. Give the page a `<title>` of `Firstname Lastname | Projects`.
  3. Add an **ordered list** (`<ol>`) of the following projects (hint: `ol>li*3 + TAB`):
    + Class Showcase
    + Choose Your Own Adventure
    + Web Store Hack-A-Thon
4. Now go back to your landing page (`/index.html`), and edit that file to include the following:
  1. The profile image from `README.md`
  2. The social media links from `README.md`
  3. A "navigation list" at the top of your landing page, with links to 'Home' (`/`) and 'Projects' (`/projects`).
  4. At least one comment for future developers (or you!) using the syntax `<!-- comment text -->`

### Inline Styles

There are three ways to give HTML content some styles:

+ inline styles (the `style` attribute)
+ style tags (`<style>` in document `<head>`)
+ stylesheets (external documents linked with `<link>`)

Today, we're going to take a look at inline styles. Inline styles are generally avoided in production websites, but you'll still see them in the wild in old codebases or in some niche applications (like MailChimp templates). To get a feel for inline styles, take a look at the following code:

```html
  <body style="background-color:lightgrey">
    <h1 style="color:blue">This is a heading</h1>
    <h1 style="color:#AA22FF">Also a heading</h1>
    <h1 style="color:rgb(0,255,255)">Moar!!</h1>
    <p style="color:red;background-color:green">This is a paragraph.</p>
    <img src="https://i.imgur.com/81qyN1y.jpg" style="height:100px;width:100px">
  </body>
```
Try writing it out in a new HTML document in your `exercises` directory, then previewing the result in your browser.

So what have we learned?
1. The value of the HTML attribute named style styles HTML elements
2. The styles are described using a language called CSS. Here are the rules of CSS:
3. CSS rules are key-value pairs (similar to HTML attributes)
4. The key represent the property to be changed (like 'color' or 'background-color')
5. The value represents what it should be changed to ('blue' or 'red')
6. The key and value are separated by a colon
7. Each key-value pair is separated with a semi-colon
8. Colors can be described by name, as eight digit hex (base 16) values between 0 (black) and F (white), or as Red Green Blue triplets from 0 to 255
9. We can use the following css colors for our background-color and color attributes:
![css color table](http://reactorprep.herokuapp.com/assets/images/css_colors.jpg)

---

### Portfolio Project 1

Let's create a theme for your Portfolio Project's landing page.

1. Use the following attributes somewhere on the page:
  + `background-color`
  + `color`
  + `width`
  + `height`
2. Make sure that all styles are inlined with the syntax `style=" "`
3. Stage and commit your changes using `git`.
4. Push your committed changes to your GitHub account.

---

Let's try out a few more styles. We won't get to every CSS property today (or in this course), but you can always find an exhaustive and up-to-date list of every property at [this address](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Reference) Try out the following HTML in your browser:

```html
  <h1 style="font-family:verdana;color:orange;">This is a heading</h1>
  <p style="color:green;">This <i style="color:orange;font-size:300%">is</i> a paragraph.</p>
  <p style="color:green;">This <i style="font-size:300%;">is</i> a paragraph.</p>
  <p style="color:green;font-size:40px;text-align:center;font-family:'Times New Roman';">This is a paragraph.</p>
```
What did we learn?
1. Styles applied to parent elements effect their children (nested) elements, unless that style is overwritten.
2. We can put a lot of styles on a single HTML element, but it gets messy.
3. We can apply the same style to every tag of a particular type (all paragraphs should be green), but we have to reapply it on each element.

The last two points are reasons why inlining styles is generally frowned upon. So how do we solve that problem?

---

## The `<style>` tag

So let's begin to refactor the mess above. CSS rules can be applied to an HTML page by placing them inside a `<style>` element inside the `<head>` element of the page.

We begin with a selector to indicate which elements the rules apply to. Then, inside of curly braces, we indicate how the elements should be styled. Declarations are split into two parts (a property and a value), are separated by a colon, and end with a semicolon, like so:

```html
<html>
    <head>
    <style>
      h1 {
        font-family: verdana;
      }
      p {
        color: green;
      }
      i {
        font-size: 300%;
      }
    </style>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1 style="color:orange;">This is a heading</h1>
    <p>This <i style="color:orange;">is</i> a paragraph.</p>
    <p>This <i>is</i> a paragraph.</p>
    <p style="font-size:300%;text-align:center;font-family:'Times New Roman';">This is by far the most important part of the page!</p>
  </body>
</html>

```

Ok, so far, so good. We have styles common to tags of the same type as shared styles. How can we represent all the extra styling on that last `<p>` tag?

Every HTML element can carry an `id` attribute to uniquely identify it. No two elements on the same page may have the same value for their `id` attributes. The css selector to match for an `id` starts with a hash (`#`).

Here's how we might apply extra styling to the important `<p>` tag in this example:

```html
<html>
  <head>
    <style>
      h1 {
        font-family: verdana;
      }
      p {
        color: green;
      }
      i {
        font-size: 300%;
      }
      #primary {
        font-size: 300%;
        text-align: center;
        font-family: 'Times New Roman';
      }
    </style>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1 style="color:orange;">This is a heading</h1>
    <p>This <i style="color:orange;">is</i> a paragraph.</p>
    <p>This <i>is</i> a paragraph.</p>
    <p id="primary">This is by far the most important part of the page!</p>
  </body>
</html>
```
Okay, now what about the two oranged elements?

Every HTML element can also carry one or more `class` names in a `class` attribute to identify several elements as being different from the other elements on the page. The css selector to match for a class starts with a period (`.`). Here's how we might add a class to our example:

```html
<html>
  <head>
    <style>
      h1 {
          font-family: verdana;
      }
      p {
        color: green;
      }
      .big {
        font-size: 300%;
      }
      #primary {
        text-align: center;
        font-family: 'Times New Roman';
      }
      .important {
        color: orange;
      }
    </style>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1 class="important">This is a heading</h1>
    <p>This <i class="important big">is</i> a paragraph.</p>
    <p>This <i class="big">is</i> a paragraph.</p>
    <p  id="primary" class="big">This is by far the most important part of the page!</p>
  </body>
<html>
```

Elements can have more than one class, but should only ever have a single id. Why is that?

Now we have separated **presentation** from **content**. We can easily read the content of our HTML document without it being cluttered up with styles. By sharing styles we also save ourselves a lot of typing as we create larger and larger HTML documents.

### Portfolio Project 2

**You will be judged** by professional developers for placing styles directly on HTML elements. Let's fix your Portfolio Project to reflect proper CSS design patterns:

1. Purge your landing page's HTML elements of `style=" "` attributes. Move all styling to a `<style>` tag in the `<head>`
2. Look for (or change your code to create) opportunities to use `id` and `class` attributes.
3. Stage, commit, push, and deploy your new Portfolio Site

---

## More HTML elements

### Portfolio Project 3

Now it's time to add a few more elements to our Portfolio Project pages.
1. Anchor tags (`<a href=""></a>`) have been used already to link to websites using `http` or `https`. They can also be used to automatically draft an email and open it in a browser window for users to send! Try the following:
    1. On your landing page, add a 'Contact Me' link.
    2. Inside the `href` attribute, use `mailto:` + your email address instead of `http:` + a website URL. Your new element should look something like `<a href="mailto:your.email@example.com?Subject=Contact%20Form">Contact Me</a>`.
2. Stage, Commit, Push and Deploy your new landing page!

---

### Portfolio Project 4

With the time remaining, let's add a Media page to your portfolio project. That means creating a `media` directory with an `index.html` file at the root of the new directory, just like we did with our `projects` page. Once that's set up, run through the following steps:
1. In your list of navigation links on your landing page, add a link to `media/`.
2. Inside of `media`, try a few more [HTML5 media elements](http://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_new_elements.asp) (at the bottom of the linked page).
3. Style your page with a style tag in the head of the document
4. Stage, commit, push, and deploy your changes!
